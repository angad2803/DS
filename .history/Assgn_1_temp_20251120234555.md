## Question 1: Assign and Print Values to Variables

Assign 23.4, 45, and 678 to variables A, B, and C respectively.

```r
A <- 23.4
B <- 45
C <- 678

print(A)
print(B)
print(C)
```

---

## Question 2: Display All Variables Created

```r
ls()    # Lists all objects in the environment
```

---

## Question 3: Remove Variable C and Display List Again

```r
rm(C)
ls()    # C will not appear in the list
```

---

## Question 4: Create a Comment "I am learning R"

```r
# I am learning R
```

---

## Question 5: Create String Variables for First Name and Last Name

```r
firstname <- "MyName"
lastname <- "MySurname"

print(firstname)
print(lastname)
```

---

## Question 6: Create a Variable that Can Hold 0 or 1

```r
binary_var <- c(0, 1)
print(binary_var)
```

---

## Question 7: Perform Arithmetic Operations on A, B, C

Recreate C since it was removed in Question 3.

```r
C <- 678    # Recreate C for calculations

# Addition
result_add <- A + B + C
print(paste("Addition:", result_add))

# Subtraction
result_sub <- A - B - C
print(paste("Subtraction:", result_sub))

# Multiplication
result_mult <- A * B * C
print(paste("Multiplication:", result_mult))

# Division
result_div <- A / B / C
print(paste("Division:", result_div))
```

---

## Question 8: Apply Mathematical Functions

```r
# Exponential function
exp(2)

# Natural logarithm
log(50)

# Logarithm base 10
log10(1000)

# Logarithm base 2
log2(32)

# Value of Pi
pi

# Square root
sqrt(81)
```

---

## Question 9: Solve Mathematical Expressions

### Expression 1: 23 + (4.5 × 2.3) / 10

```r
expr1 <- 23 + (4.5 * 2.3) / 10
print(expr1)
```

---

### Expression 2: 456 / 12 – log(90)

```r
expr2 <- 456 / 12 - log(90)
print(expr2)
```

---

### Expression 3: exp(5) + 12 / (5^6)

```r
expr3 <- exp(5) + 12 / (5^6)
print(expr3)
```

---

### Expression 4: √45 × 12 / 3

```r
expr4 <- sqrt(45) * 12 / 3
print(expr4)
```
