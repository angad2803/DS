### Q2. Display Column Names and Rename Columns

Rename: `year` → `YEAR`, `job` → `GoogleKnowlege_Occupation`, `date` → `Show`, `category` → `Group`, `guest_name` → `Raw_Guest_List`

```r
colnames(df)

df <- df %>%
  rename(
    YEAR = year,
    GoogleKnowlege_Occupation = job,
    Show = date,
    Group = category,
    Raw_Guest_List = guest_name
  )

head(df)
```

---

### Q3. Create Report with Selected Columns

Create a report containing only YEAR, Show, and Raw_Guest_List.

```r
report <- df %>%
  select(YEAR, Show, Raw_Guest_List)

head(report)
```

### Q4. Select All Records EXCEPT YEAR Column

```r
df_without_year <- df %>%
  select(-YEAR)

head(df_without_year)
```

---

### Q5. Filter Records by Occupation and Name

Extract list of people who are "actor" and have the name "ABC".

```r
actor_ABC <- df %>%
  filter(
    GoogleKnowlege_Occupation == "actor" &
    Raw_Guest_List == "ABC"
  )

print(actor_ABC)
```

---

### Q6. Arrange Records by Show Date

```r
df_sorted <- df %>%
  arrange(Show)

head(df_sorted)
```

---

### Q7. Add New Column "Experience" Using mutate()

Calculate Experience as the number of years since 1990.

```r
df <- df %>%
  mutate(Experience = YEAR - 1990)

head(df)
```
